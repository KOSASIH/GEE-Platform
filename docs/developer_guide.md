## Introduction

GEE-Platform provides a number of APIs and tools that allow you to develop custom integrations and extensions for the platform. This guide will introduce you to these APIs and tools, and provide guidance on how to use them to build custom solutions.

## API

The GEE-Platform API is a RESTful API that allows you to manage your Geospatial data and workflows programmatically. The API is organized around the following endpoints:

- Data Management: `/api/data/`
- Workflows: `/api/workflows/`

You can find more information about the API in the [API Reference](api_reference.md).

## Webhooks

GEE-Platform supports webhooks, which allow you to receive notifications when certain events occur in the platform. For example, you can set up a webhook to receive a notification when a new data file is uploaded or when a workflow completes.

To set up a webhook, send a `POST` request to the `/api/webhooks/` endpoint with the following fields in the request body:

- `name`: The name of the webhook.
- `url`: The URL to send the notification to.
- `events`: A list of events to receive notifications for.

The available events are:

- `data_created`: A new data file was uploaded.
- `data_updated`: A data file was updated.
- `data_deleted`: A data file was deleted.
- `workflow_completed`: A workflow completed successfully.
- `workflow_failed`: A workflow failed to complete.

When an event occurs, GEE-Platform will send a `POST` request to the URL specified in the webhook with a JSON payload containing information about the event.

## Custom Integrations

GEE-Platform allows you to develop custom integrations with other systems and services. For example, you can develop an integration with a Geospatial data provider to automatically import new data into GEE-Platform.

To develop a custom integration, you can use the GEE-Platform API and webhooks to interact with the platform programmatically. You can also use the GEE-Platform SDK, which provides a set of tools and libraries for developing custom integrations.

## Development Environment

To develop custom integrations and extensions for GEE-Platform, you'll need to set up a development environment. The following steps will help you get started:

1. Install Python: GEE-Platform is built using Python, so you'll need to install Python on your development machine. We recommend using Python 3.
2. Install pip: pip is the package manager for Python, and it's used to install the GEE-Platform SDK and other dependencies.
3. Install the GEE-Platform SDK: The GEE-Platform SDK provides a set of tools and libraries for developing custom integrations and extensions. You can install it using pip:

`pip install gee-platform-sdk`

4. Write your custom integration or extension: You can now use the GEE-Platform SDK to develop your custom integration or extension.

5. Test your integration or extension: Make sure to thoroughly test your integration or extension using the GEE-Platform API and webhooks.

6. Deploy your integration or extension: Once your integration or extension is ready, you can deploy it to a server or a cloud platform.

 You can install it using pip:
